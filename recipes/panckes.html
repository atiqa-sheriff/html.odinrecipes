      <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder,
        and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and melted butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just
        combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount
        of butter or oil to coat the surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook
        until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until golden
        brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter or oil as needed.
