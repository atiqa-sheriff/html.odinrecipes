        Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with
        parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated
        sugar, and brown sugar until well combined and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat in the eggs, one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Mix
        until smooth.

      <li>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.

        Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until
        just combined. Avoid overmixing.

      <li>
        Fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the
        dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet,
        spacing them about 2 inches apart.

        Remove from the oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a
        few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
